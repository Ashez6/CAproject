# CAproject
CSEN601 project
In this Project, we conducted a simulation to the Von Neumann Architecture
that includes pipelining. The simulation code shows the behavior of a MIPS
(Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages) processor, allowing us to
observe the execution of MIPS assembly instructions and the behavior of its
pipeline stages.
